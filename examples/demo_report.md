- Unique IPs: 9
- Total events: 17
- Session/event ratio: 82.4%

## Recommendations

- IMMEDIATE: Review and block top attacking IPs in Cloudflare Firewall
- Enable CAPTCHA on checkout to disrupt card-testing automation
- Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints (max 3 attempts per session)
- Remove or restrict direct URL access to $0/warranty products
- Add referrer validation -- block checkout without prior browse session
- Deploy IP-based rate limiting (Cloudflare WAF or application-level)
- Block known bot user-agents at the edge (Cloudflare WAF rule)
- Review Cloudflare Firewall rules for datacenter ASN traffic
- Consider geo-blocking or CAPTCHA challenge for high-risk regions
- Enable Cloudflare Bot Management or JS challenge for new sessions
